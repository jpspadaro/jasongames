# Foundation Risus
*2019-05-23*

Tonight I had the chance to GM a Risus game based on the SCP Foundation universe. It was as stripped down as you could get... My kids created a couple of characters (my son created an Agent, while my daughter was willingly a D-Class), and we rolled for a random SCP from the site. I got a 4 digit number, read the entry, and away we went.

The SCP we rolled was [SCP-2119](http://scp-wiki.net/scp-2119), a combination amature radio/brain parasite that could spread like an infection. After finding the location of the host,  the host died. Time to send in the D-Class. She pokes around, passes out, then gets infected. We wrapped up with the trip back to a Foundation, a researcher interview, and the incident described a the end of the entry.

Overall, pretty fun, and it was definitely new doing something low prep with such a detailed existing universe to adhere to. Both the kids want to do it again, which sounds good to me.
