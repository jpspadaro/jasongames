# Risus GM Adventure Tool

[TOC]

This is a quick step by step for adventure creation with some ideas on how to build one quickly.

_Plot points are in italics._
**Player text is in bold.**

## Settings
These are the general larger areas that the players will be adventuring in. Only assign cliches if the environment itself may be antagonistic. These should contain multiple interconnected locations.

## Antagonist
Create these as characters, with a minimum of 10 point of cliches (equalling the players).

## Quest
The overarching goal of the scenario. McGuffin? Save the Princess? Assasination? Get more loot?

## Henchmen
Like the antagonists, but only one or two cliches with a few points based on difficulties. Actions as a group can be handled based on number i.e. 5 Orcs together may be considered to have "Rock pusher(5)".

## Locations
- Name using their cliches, or provide multiple cliches in the description. Assign a level for these.
	- Use TNs for simple traps and obstacles.
	- More complex stuff, or stuff based on the environment should be using the room's level.
- Provide any NPCs in the room.
- Provide any special items in the room (ones that add dice).
- Show somehow (map, mindmap, etc.) how they connect to other locations.

## Plot Points
These are events that aren't tied to specific locations, or have a more abstract relationship with the adventure. You may want to sprinkle these in rather than a separate section.
